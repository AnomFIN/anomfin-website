Copilot General Workflow — “Anom Hacker Page”

Goal:
Create a fully responsive, ultra-stylish hacker-themed webpage for the Anom ecosystem (e.g. AnomFIN, AnomTools, AnomApps).
It must look professional, cinematic, and futuristic — blending dark neon aesthetics, glass/blur effects, dynamic glow, and tech-startup polish (think Tesla × Anonymous × Apple).
